Get Started

==========

(1) Get vFramework in one of 4 ways:

* clone & build this repository
* via Bower: by running $ bower install angular-collection console

(2) Include vsoft.js (or vsoft.min.js) in your index.html, after including Angular itself (For Component users: ignore this step)
(3) Include Config.js in your index.html
(4) Add 'vFramework' to your main module's list of dependencies 

When you're done, your setup should look similar to the following:

==========

```
<script src="bower_components/angular-collection/angular-collection.min.js"></script>

<script src="scripts/Config.js"></script>
<script src="scripts/vsoft.js"></script>
```
